        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm <strong>John Stanley</strong> – a U.S. Air Force veteran with a strong background in aerospace
            maintenance and a growing passion for digital technology. I spent <strong>8 years and 8 months</strong>
            serving
            as a <strong>Jet Engine Technician</strong>, where I developed a meticulous eye for detail, problem-solving
            skills, and a commitment to excellence.
        </p>
        <p>
            After my military career, I transitioned into the tech world through a <strong>3-year internship with Pratt
                &
                Whitney Canada</strong>. During this time, I worked on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web development projects improving internal tools and workflows</li>
            <li>Custom applications built with <strong>C# and Unity</strong></li>
            <li>Lotus Notes database redevelopment</li>
            <li>Modern SharePoint and WebCon form solutions</li>
            <li>Supporting teams as a SharePoint Admin and Designer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Currently, I’m a <strong>F135 Technician at Pratt & Whitney</strong>, continuing my hands-on work in the
            aerospace field while expanding my expertise in technology and development.
        </p>
        <p>
            In just a few weeks, I’ll be graduating with a <strong>Bachelor's degree in Digital Media and Web
                Design</strong>, combining my technical background with creative problem-solving skills to build
            meaningful,
            user-focused digital experiences.

                <h3>Understanding Search Engine Optimization Basics</h3>
                <p>This project explores the fundamentals of SEO and demonstrates how search engines operate through
                    crawling, indexing, and ranking. It highlights the role of meta tags, focusing on keywords and
                    descriptions, to improve search visibility and click-through rates. The project also explains how to
                    create relevant content links using effective anchor text, maintaining contextual and destination
                    relevance, and providing clear link purposes. Lastly, it emphasizes the importance of proper heading
                    hierarchy to organize content logically, improve readability, and signal content importance to
                    search
                    engines, improving discoverability and user experience.</p>

                <h3>Responsive Design & Analytics</h3>
                <p>This project demonstrates the importance of responsive web design and preprocessing in modern web
                    development. It highlights how responsive layouts enhance user experience by adapting to various
                    screen
                    sizes, improving accessibility, SEO rankings, and reducing bounce rates. The project also explores
                    website analytics, focusing on key Google Analytics reports such as Audience, Acquisition, and
                    Behavior,
                    providing valuable insights into user demographics, traffic sources, and engagement. Additionally,
                    it
                    compares client-side and server-side preprocessing techniques, showcasing the benefits of tools like
                    LESS and SASS for efficient styling, reusable code, and improved site performance.</p>

                <h3>Mountain Mamma's Bakery Website</h3>
                <p>This project is a fully responsive, 10-page website designed for a fictional home-based bakery
                    located in
                    West Virginia. The site highlights the bakery’s products and services with a visually appealing
                    wheat-toned theme, hero images, and a fixed navigation menu for easy browsing. It includes a blog,
                    gallery, menu, services, and contact page with a functional form and validation. Accessibility and
                    SEO
                    best practices were implemented, including meta tags, optimized images, a privacy policy, and an XML
                    sitemap. This project demonstrates my ability to design a professional, user-friendly website with
                    consistent branding and engaging content.</p>

                <h3>Great Escape</h3>
                <p>Great Escape is a fast-paced 3D endless runner game set in a bustling city environment. Built with
                    Unity,
                    the game challenges players to navigate through streets filled with traffic barriers, cones, and
                    other
                    obstacles while collecting stars to increase their score. Featuring engaging background music and
                    immersive particle effects, the game delivers a visually dynamic and entertaining experience.
                    Designed
                    with responsive controls and smooth mechanics, Great Escape demonstrates my ability to create
                    interactive gameplay, implement collision detection, manage scoring systems, and integrate
                    audio-visual
                    elements in a polished Unity project.</p>

                <p>This project is a basic wireframe concept for a fictional band, the Citadel Kings. The homepage
                    displays a list
                    of upcoming concerts, with a “Buy Tickets” button that opens a side panel for ticket purchases. The
                    second page
                    provides band details on an about section, while the final store page allows users to browse
                    merchandise. A cart
                    button opens a side panel where users can add or remove items, view totals, and proceed to checkout.
                    This
