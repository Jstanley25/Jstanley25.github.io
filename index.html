        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm <strong>John Stanley</strong> – a U.S. Air Force veteran with a strong background in aerospace
            maintenance and a growing passion for digital technology. I spent <strong>8 years and 8 months</strong>
            serving
            as a <strong>Jet Engine Technician</strong>, where I developed a meticulous eye for detail, problem-solving
            skills, and a commitment to excellence.
        </p>
        <p>
            After my military career, I transitioned into the tech world through a <strong>3-year internship with Pratt
                &
                Whitney Canada</strong>. During this time, I worked on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web development projects improving internal tools and workflows</li>
            <li>Custom applications built with <strong>C# and Unity</strong></li>
            <li>Lotus Notes database redevelopment</li>
            <li>Modern SharePoint and WebCon form solutions</li>
            <li>Supporting teams as a SharePoint Admin and Designer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Currently, I’m a <strong>F135 Technician at Pratt & Whitney</strong>, continuing my hands-on work in the
            aerospace field while expanding my expertise in technology and development.
        </p>
        <p>
            In just a few weeks, I’ll be graduating with a <strong>Bachelor's degree in Digital Media and Web
                Design</strong>, combining my technical background with creative problem-solving skills to build
            meaningful,
            user-focused digital experiences.

                <h3>Understanding Search Engine Optimization Basics</h3>
                <p>This project explores the fundamentals of SEO and demonstrates how search engines operate through
                    crawling, indexing, and ranking. It highlights the role of meta tags, focusing on keywords and
                    descriptions, to improve search visibility and click-through rates. The project also explains how to
                    create relevant content links using effective anchor text, maintaining contextual and destination
                    relevance, and providing clear link purposes. Lastly, it emphasizes the importance of proper heading
                    hierarchy to organize content logically, improve readability, and signal content importance to
                    search
                    engines, improving discoverability and user experience.</p>

                <h3>Responsive Design & Analytics</h3>
                <p>This project demonstrates the importance of responsive web design and preprocessing in modern web
                    development. It highlights how responsive layouts enhance user experience by adapting to various
                    screen
                    sizes, improving accessibility, SEO rankings, and reducing bounce rates. The project also explores
                    website analytics, focusing on key Google Analytics reports such as Audience, Acquisition, and
                    Behavior,
                    providing valuable insights into user demographics, traffic sources, and engagement. Additionally,
                    it
                    compares client-side and server-side preprocessing techniques, showcasing the benefits of tools like
                    LESS and SASS for efficient styling, reusable code, and improved site performance.</p>
